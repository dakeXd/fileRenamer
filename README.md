# fileRenamer
Little program that renames all the files in a directory

Made in java by Manuel Abarca
The program will ask for a base name for all the files in the directory, and will rename all of them using that base name and an index, that will be started in 1.

This index will have the same number of digits for all the files. If the directory have 100 files, the first index will be 001, if it have 1000, the index will be 0001... etc.
